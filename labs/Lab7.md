# Lab 7 Example

Here is how I used my module Howdoi

```bash
source ~/venv/scripts/bin/activate
pip3 install Howdoi 
```

Now you can use the Howdoi command in python to lookup answers to whatever you want.

```python
Import Howdoi

Howdoi use howdoi
```

This will provide instructions with how to use Howdoi

```python
Import Howdoi

Howdoi push to git

That was not fun. Remember to deactivate.
