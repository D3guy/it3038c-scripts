# Project 2 Read ME

Make sure that this command is running or else the second part of the project will fail

```bash
source ~/venv/scripts/bin/activate
```
This project is a continuation of the first project that was designed to give the users a snake of appropriate length. Now it will give the user a helpful tool to
help improve their experience of Python.

This will eventually be a script containing lots of usefull Python features and fun facts about snakes
