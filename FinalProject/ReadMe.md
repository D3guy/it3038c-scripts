# Final Project ReadMe
Make sure that this command is running or else the second part of the project will fail

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```
After this has been done run the following command

```bash
pip install axju-jokes
```
With this commands performed the script should be good to go.

This project is a continuation of the second project that was designed to give the users a snake of appropriate length and give instructions.
Now it will provide users with a collection of random jokes pulled from an api as well as call the user names based on their preferences

To use the script simply run the script and respond to the questions using typed numbers such as 0,1,2 etc.

For more information on this code check the comments on the code itself



As for why this code is usefull. I think that the ability to be provided a near unlimited supply of terrible early 2000's speaks for itself. It is sometimes difficult to think of joke this bad on the spot but with this script you can generate as many as you like.
