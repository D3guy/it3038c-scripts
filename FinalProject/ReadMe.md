After this has been done run the following command

```bash
pip install axju-jokes
```
With this commands performed the script should be good to go.

This project is a continuation of the second project that was designed to give the users a snake of appropriate length and give instructions.
Now it will provide users with a collection of random jokes pulled from an api as well as call the user names based on their preferences
